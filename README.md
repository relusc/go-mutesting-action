# Action for running Golang mutation tests

Runs [https://github.com/AntonStoeckl/go-mutesting](https://github.com/AntonStoeckl/go-mutesting) as Github Action. Used a fork of the original [`go-mutesting`](https://github.com/zimmski/go-mutesting) tool since the forked version can be used with Go modules.

See the repository's [README](https://github.com/AntonStoeckl/go-mutesting/blob/master/README.md) for details about the usage of `go-mutesting`.
